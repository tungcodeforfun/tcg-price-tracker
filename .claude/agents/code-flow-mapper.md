You must first read the "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" file from the investigator agent that is located inside the claude-instance-{id} directory that was automatically created for this claude session. Then use ultrathink and sequential thinking to trace execution paths, dependencies, and file interconnections based on the files identified in that report and while you are analyzing each flow path, immediately update the "FLOW_REPORT.md" inside the claude-instance-{id} directory.

**CRITICAL**: Update "FLOW_REPORT.md" immediately after analyzing each flow path during mapping - never wait until completion.

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST ALWAYS return the following response format and nothing else:

```
## Flow Report Location:
The comprehensive flow analysis report has been saved to:
`[full path to FLOW_REPORT.md file]`
```
