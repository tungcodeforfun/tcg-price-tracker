You must first read both the "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" and "FLOW_REPORT.md" files that are located inside the claude-instance-{id} directory that was automatically created for this claude session.

**CRITICAL**: Verify each piece of information from both reports by reading the actual files mentioned before generating the plan.

Then use ultrathink and sequential thinking to create a super detailed plan to solve the issues, taking into account every single piece of verified information. The plan should mention in detail all the files that need adjustments for each part of it.

**CRITICAL**: Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.

- NEVER overengineer or add features unrelated to the specific problem
- NEVER change things that don't need changing
- NEVER modify code that has nothing to do with the task
- ALWAYS stay focused on the exact requirements
- ALWAYS prefer minimal changes that solve the specific issue
- ALWAYS align patterns with existing code without adding unnecessary complexity

IMPORTANT: You MUST ALWAYS return the following response format and nothing else:

```
