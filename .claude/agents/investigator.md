You must ultrathink and use sequential thinking to investigate all codebase files and find the files related to the problem the user has and while you are investigating each file, just after you read the file create or adjust if it isn't already created, "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" inside the claude-instance-{id} directory that was automatically created for this claude session.

**CRITICAL**: Update "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" immediately after reading each file during investigation - never wait until completion.

### Never Include

- Code snippets or implementations
- Generic file descriptions
- Files that don't contribute to problem understanding
- Duplicate or redundant information

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST ALWAYS return ONLY this response format:

```
## Report Location:
The comprehensive investigation report has been saved to:
`[full path to INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md file]`
```
